# MyReads Project

This is the starter template for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The goal of this template is to save you time by providing a static example of the CSS and HTML markup that may be used, but without any of the React code that is needed to complete the project. If you choose to start with this template, your job will be to add interactivity to the app by refactoring the static code in this template.

Of course, you are free to start this project from scratch if you wish! Just be sure to use [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) to bootstrap the project.

## Prerequisites

To run a React app, you'll need a few prerequisites in place. Here's a step-by-step guide on what you'll need:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager):
  React is built using Node.js, so you'll need to install Node.js which includes npm, a package manager for JavaScript. You can download Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org

## TL;DR

Running the React App

- Clone this project:

```
git clone https://github.com/quangdang2001/udacity-react-01
```

- Navigate to the Project Directory: <br>
  Change your current directory to the project directory you just created:

```bash
cd udacity-react-01
```

- Start the Development Server: <br>
  Run the following command to start the development server and launch the React app: <br>

```
npm install: in the project root directory to install dependency
```

```
npm start: to launch the project
```

This command will start the development server and automatically open your React app in a web browser. The app will automatically reload whenever you make changes to the source code.

Now you have your React app up and running! You can start building your application by editing the code in the src directory of your project.

    ├── index.css # Global styles. You probably won't need to change anything here.
    └── index.js # You should not need to modify this file. It is used for DOM rendering only.
```

Remember that good React design practice is to create new JS files for each component and use import/require statements to include them where they are needed.

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.
